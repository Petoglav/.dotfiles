# Authentication

Authenticate the app using API keys as bearer tokens. Always provide the Authorization header containing your API key as bearer token:

```Bash
Authorization: Bearer <oauth-token>
```

> Note: Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure. Do not share your API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub or through client-side code. When possible, encrypt API keys when you store them.
